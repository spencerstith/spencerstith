## Welcome to Spencer Stith's GitHub!

I am a Computer Science & Mathematics major / Cyber Security minor at The University of Tulsa.

A lot of my time goes into creative/visual coding projects, which you can see in my list of repositories (usually in the [Processing](https://processing.org) language).

I have been getting more into the Computational Sciences side of things.
This is what I am most passionate about; ✨**making mathematical-based software is my dream**. ✨
