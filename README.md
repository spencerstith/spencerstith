## Welcome to Spencer Stith's GitHub!

I am a Computer Science & Mathematics major / Cyber Security minor graduate from The University of Tulsa. I am currently on the hunt for a job!

A lot of my time goes into creative/visual coding projects, which you can see in my list of repositories (usually in the [Processing](https://processing.org) language). I have also been working on a library, [TinySet](https://www.github.com/spencerstith/TinySet), which is a database helper for Java.

I have been getting more into the Computational Sciences side of things.
This is what I am most passionate about; ✨making mathematical-based software is my dream. ✨
