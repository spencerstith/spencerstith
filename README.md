A lot of my time goes into creative/visual coding projects, which you can see in my list of repositories (usually in the [Processing](https://processing.org) language).

I have been getting more into the Computational Sciences side of things.
This is what I am most passionate about; ‚ú®**making mathematical-based software is my dream**. ‚ú®

I do a lot of helper tools (such as my [Markdown Constructor](https://github.com/spencerstith/Markdown-Constructor) project) to assist me with Java-based data analytics (sometimes Python too!).

Recently, I have been expanding my knowledge and work into more web-based projects to keep up with the fact that most companies' software is online now and I am having a good time doing so.
